Rank several embeddings on different criteria
#############################################

In this experiment they are evaluated: 

- Multiple queries grouped under different criteria (gender, ethnicity, religion)
- Multiple embeddings
- Multiple metrics. 

From the results grouped by query criteria, rankings of the bias that was detected in each embedding model are generated by metric and plotted. An overall is included, which is simply the sum of all the rankings by model and by metric.

Finally, the matrix of correlations between these rankings is calculated and plotted.

The code of this experiment is relatively long, as is the time of its execution.
You can see it in his Jupyter Notebook using the following `link <https://github.com/dccuchile/wefe/blob/master/examples/WEFE_rankings.ipynb>`_.
